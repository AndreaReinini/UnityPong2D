**University Project: UnityPong2D - Engaging 2D Pong Experience**

**Degree Program:** Information Engineering for Video Games and Virtual Reality

**Course:** User Experience and 2D Graphics

**Description:**
Explore **UnityPong2D**, a captivating project that merges minimalist graphic design with a meticulously crafted gameplay logic. Immerse yourself in the fluidity and excitement of a 2D Pong game, accompanied by immersive music that enhances the gaming experience. The intuitive control system, paired with a dedicated controller, takes gameplay to a new level.

**Acquired Skills**
In this initial game development endeavor, I collaborated with a fellow university colleague. My focus was on the graphical aspects and physical construction of controllers, while providing support to my colleague in the coding process. I initiated the project, and he contributed his expertise in C# programming and software development, which were instrumental in realizing this project.

**Please Note: Currently, the game is playable only with the physical controller, but it offers a well-structured Pong experience for those seeking precisely that.**
